    <h2>Classic British dish Shepahrds Pie</h2>
    <P>Shepherd's Pie is a classic British comfort food, traditionally made with minced lamb, though beef can be used in variations known as "Cottage Pie." This hearty dish layers a savory meat filling with vegetables like carrots, peas, and onions, all cooked in a rich, flavorful gravy. The filling is then topped with a generous layer of creamy mashed potatoes, which are often browned under the grill for a crispy, golden finish.
        Originally a dish to make use of leftover meat, Shepherd's Pie has evolved into a beloved staple of British cuisine. The combination of tender, seasoned lamb and buttery mashed potatoes makes it a satisfying and warming meal, especially popular during colder months. It's typically served on its own or accompanied by seasonal vegetables and a side of gravy for extra indulgence.</P>
